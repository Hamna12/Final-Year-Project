|--------------|-------------|------------------|--------|----------|
| 1. Data Collection | Gather school exit exam data from the past 9 years ensuring completeness and accuracy. This involves liaising with educational authorities to obtain data. <br> **Tasks:** <br> - Organize data files for years (2015 to 2023) <br> - Perform initial assessment to understand the data | 3 | DONE | (Nov 10, 2023)<br><br>------- <br><br><br> (Nov 29, 2023) |
| 2. Data Exploration, Preprocessing & Initial Dashboarding | Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset’s characteristics.<br> **Tasks:** <br> >> **2.1: Understanding dataset characteristics** <br> (Done: Year 2015 to 2020) <br> - Structure of dataset, datatype of each column, summary statistics, perform initial analysis to identify missing values & potential area of interest, set the initial base of the dashboard (Done – Dec 15) <br><br> >> 2.2: **Perform in-depth Analysis:** <br> - Identify key features, patterns, and correlations. <br><br> >>> **2.2.1: Univariate Analysis:** <br> (Done: Year 2015) <br> - Explore individual attributes, display statistics, and check for missing values. Like, <br> - Identify missing values specially in subject marks columns <br> - Analyze extent of missing values and impact <br> - Identify key metrics for Dashboard visualization <br> >>> **2.2.2: Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis:** <br> - Explore relationship and patterns among different variables. Like, <br> - Explore how grades are related to each subject <br> - Analyze distribution of students' performance in each subject <br> - Explore distribution of students across different schools <br> - Analyze the role of gender in grades <br> - Identify the ratio of student gender in each school <br> - Analyze count of students from urban & rural <br> - Explore the relationship between student gender and their grades <br> - And much more, will append accordingly… <br><br> >> **2.3: Initial Dashboard Population:** <br> - Define features and functionalities for an interactive dashboard <br> - Identify and outline key visualization <br><br> >> **2.4: Data Cleaning and Structuring:** <br> - Renaming the columns <br> - Drop irrelevant values <br> - Clean the data by identifying missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies <br> - Implement mean/median method on numerical missing column data and mode on categorical data <br> - Perform further analysis steps based on insights gained during EDA | 4 | In-Progress | Expected End: (Jan, 2024) <br><br> Break for Final Exams from (15 - 20) |
| 3. Storytelling & Dashboard Designing | Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing key findings from EDA. <br> **Tasks:** <br> - Design user interface for the dashboard, outlining key visualizations such as performance trends over time (gender-wise, year-wise, subject-wise, etc.) and demographic insights. <br> - Define features and functionalities of the interactive dashboard. <br> - Integrate visualization into the dashboard interface. | 4 | - | Feb, 2024 |
| 4. Feature Engineering and Selection | Create a new feature and transform the existing ones to enhance the performance of machine learning models or improve insights from data. <br> **Tasks:** <br> - Feature engineering involves (Age calculation, subject aggregation, subjects grouping, etc) | 2 | (Not started) | March, 2024 |
| 5. Data Visualization & Descriptive Analytics | Conduct descriptive analytics to highlight overall performance metrics including, <br> **Tasks:** <br> - (subject analysis, yearly trend, gender comparison, correlation insights, geographical patterns) over the past decade. <br> - Explore correlation b/w different attributes and highlight insights and patterns in the dashboard. | 2 | - | March, 2024 |
| 6. Predictive Modeling Research | Explore suitable predictive modeling techniques for forecasting future exam performance. This may involve regression analysis, time series forecasting, or various other machine learning algorithms. | 4 | - | April, 2024 |
| 7. Predictive Modeling Implementation | Implement the selected predictive model to evaluate its performance and fine-tune the accuracy. | 2 | - | May, 2024 |
| 8. Integration with Dashboard & Translating EDA | Integrate predictive model results into the dashboard, allowing users to explore both historical data and prediction. Design components within the dashboard to show predictive model results including (graphs, charts) that effectively communicate insights. | 2 | - | May, 2024 |
| 9. User Testing, Feedback & Explore Other Frameworks If Required | Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on the dashboard’s usability and effectiveness of visualization. Make necessary adjustments based on user feedback. | 4 | - | June, 2024 |
| 11. Documentation and Reporting | Prepare comprehensive documentation, outline the project methodology, data sources, analytics techniques, and findings. Create the final project report and poster for submission. | 4 | - | July, 2024 |
