| **Work Package** | **Description** | **Time Required (Weeks)** |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| 1. **Data Collection** | Gather school exit exam data from the past 9 years ensuring completeness and accuracy. This involves liaising with educational authorities, cleaning raw data to eliminate inconsistencies and organizing it for analysis. | 2 |
| 2. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing** | Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset’s characteristics. Handle missing values, detect outliers and bring data is in suitable format.. | 3 |
| 3. **Feature Engineering and selection** | Create new feature and transform the existing ones to enhance the performance of machine learning models or improve insights from data. Feature engineering involves (Age calculation, subject aggregation, subjects grouping etc) | 2 |
| 4. **Dashboard Design** | Design user interface for the dashboard, outlining key visualizations such as performance trends over time(gender wise, year wise, subject wise, etc.) and demographic insights. Define features and functionalities of interactive dashboard. | 4 |
| 5. **Data Visualization Implementation** | Employ data visualization in the dashboard using tools such as Matplotlib, Plotly for creating informative and interactive charts to highlight key patterns. | 4 |
| 6. **Descriptive Analytics** | Conduct descriptive analytics to highlight overall performance metrics including (subject analysis, yearly trend, gender comparison, correlation insights, geographical patterns) over the past decade. | 3 |
| 7. **Predictive Modeling Research** | Explore suitable predictive modeling techniques for forecasting future exam performance. This may involve regression analysis, time series forecasting or various other machine learning algorithms.| 5 |
| 8. **Predictive Modeling Implementation** | Implement the selected predictive model and evaluate its performance using a portion of the dataset. Fine-tune the model for better accuracy if necessary. | 4 |
| 9. **Integration with Dashboard** | Integrate predictive model results into the dashboard, allowing user to explore both historical data and prediction. Design components within the dashboard to show predictive model results including (graphs, charts) that effectively communicate insights. | 3 |
| 10. **User Testing and Feedback** | Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on dashboard’s usability and effectiveness of visualization. Make necessary adjustment based on user feedback. | 2 |
| 11. **Documentation and Reporting** | Prepare comprehensive documentation , outline the project methodology, data sources, analytics techniques and findings. Create final project report and poster for submission. | 3 |
| **Total Time Required** | | **28 weeks** |
