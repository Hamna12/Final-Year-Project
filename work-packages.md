| **Work Package** | **Description** | **Time Required (Weeks)** |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| 1. **Data Collection** | Gather school exit exam data from the past 10 years, ensuring completeness and accuracy. This involves liaising with educational authorities, cleaning raw data, and organizing it for analysis. | 2 |
| 2. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing** | Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics. Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data is in a suitable format. | 3 |
| 3. **Dashboard Design** | Design the user interface for the dashboard, outlining key visualizations such as performance trends, subject-wise analysis, and demographic insights. Consider user interactivity and aesthetics. | 4 |
| 4. **Data Visualization Implementation** | Implement the visualizations in the dashboard using tools like Tableau, Power BI, or a web-based framework. Ensure that the visualizations effectively communicate trends and insights. | 4 |
| 5. **Descriptive Analytics** | Conduct descriptive analytics to highlight overall performance metrics, including average scores, pass rates, and subject-wise distributions over the past decade. | 3 |
| 6. **Predictive Modeling Research** | Explore suitable predictive modeling techniques for forecasting future exam performance. This may involve regression analysis, time series forecasting, or machine learning algorithms. | 5 |
| 7. **Predictive Modeling Implementation** | Implement the selected predictive model and evaluate its performance using a portion of the dataset. Fine-tune the model for better accuracy if necessary. | 4 |
| 8. **Integration with Dashboard** | Integrate the predictive model results into the dashboard, allowing users to explore both historical data and predictions. Ensure seamless user experience and interpretability. | 3 |
| 9. **User Testing and Feedback** | Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on the dashboard's usability and the effectiveness of visualizations. Make necessary adjustments based on feedback. | 2 |
| 10. **Documentation and Reporting** | Prepare comprehensive documentation outlining the project methodology, data sources, analysis techniques, and key findings. Create a final project report for submission. | 3 |
| **Total Time Required** | | **28 weeks** |
